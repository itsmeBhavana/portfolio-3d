# Notes

&nbsp is actual value for space.

- three.js elements do not start with div, they start with mesh.
- and then we have to use <hemisphereLight/> foe a light so that we can see something.
- <pointLight/> is a dot light or laser like light that falls on an object.
- <primitive/> is an object
- <primitive object={computer.scene} scale={0.75}/> scale to amke the object smaller
- <OrbitControls/> is used to rotate an object
  -  maxPolarAngle:90deg and minPolarAngle:90deg => cannot rotate all the way up and down left and right, can only rotate along specifix axis.
